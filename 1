Installation Steps

    Choose an Ingress Controller: While many options exist, NGINX is a popular choice due to its robustness and extensive documentation.

    Install the Controller: You'll apply a series of Kubernetes manifests that deploy the NGINX Ingress controller and its associated resources. A key part of this is the Service object for the controller, which you'll need to configure to be of type NodePort.

    Create an Ingress Resource: After the controller is running, you'll define an Ingress resource for your test service. This resource tells the Ingress controller how to route traffic from a specific host or path to your service.


Deploy NGINX Ingress: You can get the manifests directly from the NGINX Ingress project.

    First, clone the NGINX Ingress repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx.git
cd ingress-nginx/deploy/static/provider/baremetal

Then, apply the manifests. Make sure to choose the baremetal manifests, as they include the NodePort service.
Bash

    kubectl apply -f .

Verify the Installation: Check that the NGINX Ingress controller is running and the service is exposed via NodePort.
Bash

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
kubectl get service --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx

The output should show a service with TYPE as NodePort and a port mapping like 80:30080/TCP. The port 30080 is the NodePort.
